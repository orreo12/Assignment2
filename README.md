Control Structures in Python

Task1

## ✅ Description

This Python program checks whether a number entered by the user is **even or odd**.

## 🔍 How it Works

1. Prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. Uses the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
3. If divisible (remainder is 0), it prints that the number is **Even**.
4. Otherwise, it prints that the number is **Odd**.

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an Odd Number

Enter a number: 12
12 is an Even Number
```


**TASK 2**
This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. Here's how it works:

Initialization:
A variable (typically named total_sum or similar) is initialized to 0. This will hold the running total as we add each number from 1 to 50.

Iteration:
A for loop is used to iterate over the numbers in the range 1 to 50 (inclusive). Python's range(1, 51) generates numbers from 1 to 50.

Summation:
During each iteration, the current number is added to the total sum.

Output:
After the loop completes, the final sum is displayed using the print() function.

## 🧪 Example Output

```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:  1275
```
